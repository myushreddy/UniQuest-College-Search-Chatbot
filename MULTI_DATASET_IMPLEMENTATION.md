```
**Result:** Returns official NIRF rankings with enhanced details from other datasets

#### 2. **Course-Specific Queries**  
```
"Computer science colleges"
"Mechanical engineering programs"
"Colleges offering biotechnology"
```
**Result:** Returns colleges with specific programs, enriched with fee and ranking data

#### 3. **Comprehensive Filtered Searches**
```
"Cheap colleges under 3 lakhs in Maharashtra"
"Best colleges with good facilities"
"Government colleges in Tamil Nadu"
```
**Result:** Multi-criteria filtering with detailed college information

### Cross-Dataset Intelligence:
- **Name Normalization:** Intelligent matching across datasets despite name variations
- **Data Enrichment:** Automatically adds NIRF rankings to detailed college info
- **Comprehensive Responses:** Combines fees, facilities, rankings, and course data

## ‚úÖ Technical Improvements Implemented

### 1. **Encoding Issues Resolved**
- Fixed UTF-8 encoding problems with Engineering.csv
- Removed Unicode emoji characters causing Windows terminal issues
- Added fallback encoding handling (utf-8 ‚Üí latin-1 ‚Üí cp1252)

### 2. **Multi-Dataset Architecture**
```python
class MultiDatasetCollegeChatbot:
    def __init__(self):
        self.df_main = None      # Detailed college info (5,446 records)
        self.df_nirf = None      # NIRF rankings (200 records)  
        self.df_courses = None   # Course details (2,920 records)
```

### 3. **Intelligent Query Routing**
- Detects query intent (ranking, course, general search)
- Routes to appropriate dataset automatically
- Combines results from multiple sources when relevant

### 4. **Enhanced Response Formatting**
- Clear, structured responses with relevant information
- Cross-references data between datasets
- Prioritizes most relevant information based on query type

## üéØ Real-World Query Examples & Results

### **Query:** "Top 5 NIRF ranked colleges"
**Dataset Used:** NIRF Rankings + Main Dataset
**Result:** Official top 5 IITs with enhanced location and fee information

### **Query:** "Computer science colleges" 
**Dataset Used:** Course-Specific + Main + NIRF
**Result:** Colleges offering CS programs with fees, locations, and rankings

### **Query:** "Show me colleges ranked 10-15"
**Dataset Used:** NIRF + Main Dataset  
**Result:** NIRF ranks 10-15 with detailed fee and facility information

## üîß System Status
